<b># refresher</b>

a function is defined with three sets, (A, B, Γ), where Γ ⊆ A x B
take a function f. we can write the application of f as f(x), where

<b>## injective functions</b>

given f : A −→  B,

functions that map elements from the domain into distinct elements
of the codomain are called "injective" or "one-to-one".

this is graphically equivalent to the "horizontal line test", where there must be <= 1 solution.

∀ x1, x2 ∈ A, x1 ≠ x2 ⇒ f(x1) ≠ f(x2)
or
∀ x1, x2 ∈ A, f(x1) = f(x2) ⇒ x1 = x2

e.g. sin is not injective, as sin 0 = sin π = 0.
however,

f : [-π/2, π/2] −→  R
    x |→  sin(x)

is injective.

<b>## surjective functions</b>

we say that f is "surjective" or "onto" if f(A) = B.
or
∀ y ∈ B, ∃ x ∈ A, m ∈ Γ : m = (x, y)

This means that every element of the codomain can be reached by applying f to an element of A.

this is equivalent to the horizontal line test, where there must be >= 1 solution.

e.g. take the function f, where

f : R −→  R
    x |→  e^x

f is not surjective, as nonpositive values cannot be reached.

If we take the image of a function I ( { f(x) | x ∈ A } ),
obviously every function becomes surjective if we change our codomain to I

hence we can make f surjective by changing our codomain to R+*.

<b>### bijective functions</b>
we call a function that is injective and surjective "bijective" or a "one-to-one correspondence".

<b>## invertible functions</b>

if a function is bijective, it can be inverted.

take a bijective function f : A −→  B. we can invert it to get f-1: B −→  A
from this follows:
f(f-1(x)) = x, f-1(f(x)) = x

if f is not injective and we try to invert it, then we cannot get those properties,
as multiple values will be taken from the functions

<b>## function composition</b>

take two functions f, g where f : A −→  B and G : B −→  C.
we can define a composition of f and g (g ◦ f) which represents subsequent
application of f and g in that order.

this is Not commutative, as A does not necessarily equal C.

<b>## sequences</b>

a sequence is a subset of all functions where the domain is a subset of N.

e.g. f : N −→  N or g : N* −→  R

<b># real numbers</b>

we will not cover the construction of the reals.
we will assume a set has been provided named R which has two operations,
+ and · which satisfy the following properties (field axioms):

(FA1) commutative property
    ∀ a, b ∈ R, a + b = b + a and a ·b = b ·a
(FA2) associative property
    ∀ a, b, c ∈ R, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) and (a ·b) · c = a ·(b ·c)
(FA3) distributivity of multiplication over addition
    ∀ a, b, c ∈ R, (a + b) ·c = (a ·c) + (b ·c)
(FA4) there is an element "zero", written 0, which is the additive identity
    ∀ a ∈ R, a + 0 = 0 + a = a
(FA5) there is an element "one" different from 0, written 1, which is the multiplicative identity
    ∀ a ∈ R, a ·1 = 1 ·a = a
(FA6) for each element a of R there exists an element (-a) such that
    a + (−a) = (−a) + a = 0
(FA7) for each element a of R that is different from zero, there exists an element (a^-1) such that
    a ·a−1 = a−1 ·a = 1

from these, subtraction and division are defined implicitly, where

- : R x R -> R
	a, b |-> a + (-b)
/ : R x R -> R
    a, b |-> a ·(b^-1)

we can continue our description by defining order.
the relation a < b satisfies the following properties:

(OA1) ∀ a ∈ R, it is not true that a < a
(OA2) ∀ a, b ∈ R, if a < b, then it is not true that b < a
(OA3) ∀ a, b, c ∈ R, if a < b and b < c, then a < c
(OA4) ∀ a, b ∈ R and a ≠ b, then either a < b or b < a
(OA5) ∀ a, b, c ∈ R, if a < b, then a + c < b + c
(OA6) ∀ a, b, c ∈ R, if a < b and 0 < c, then ac < bc

if we write a ≤ b, a < b or a = b
we can write b > a instead of a < b, and b ≥ a instead of a ≤ b.

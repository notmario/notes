<b># features</b>

postssg is a "fully-fledged" static site generator.
it generates static sites. that's about it

<b>## syntax for files</b>

most of a file will be plain text. no special syntax,
no ending lines with two spaces, nothing. whitespace
is also preserved, because the entire page is inside
of a "pre" tag.

you can add links! wow!

<a href="index.html">=> index.pssg</a>
<a href=" https://spicata.github.io/pressg/">=> pressg | https://spicata.github.io/pressg/</a>

the first line is a link to "index.pssg". every link
that heads internally is absolute. the other line is
a link to a website. links can be aliased, indicated
by the inclusion of a "|" before the actual link.

<b>#### lines starting with at least one # will be bold</b>

lastly, postssg also has a "tags" system. tags allow
you to automatically link to all pages which contain
a specific tag. this will be demonstrated below.

if a line ends with "<--", then the file gets tagged
with the contents of the line. then, if another file
has a line which starts with "-->", all tagged files
with the tag following the --> will be linked to.

--> tag-demo
<a href="tag-demo-file.html">=> tag-demo-file.pssg</a>

there are not many features. this is intentional

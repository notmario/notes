<b># Ooops.</b>
i blundered by forgetting to bring a notebook. there probably won't
be any more digital notes for this class. oops
thankfully this one is typable (no integral etc.)

<b># logic</b>
involves manipulating propositions

some propositions are: 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 1 = 3
the first one is true, the second one is false [citation needed]

<b>## negation</b>
¬p represents the negation of p.
if p is true, ¬p is false, and if p is false, ¬p is true.
it is unary (applies to one proposition), unlike the other
connectives, which are binary (applies to two propositions)

==========
| p | ¬p |
==========
| T |  F |
| F |  T |
==========

<b>## conjunction</b>
p ∧ q is the conjunction of p and q. equivalent to "and".
p ∧ q is true if and only if p is true and q is true,
else it is false.

=================
| p | q | p ∧ q |
=================
| T | T |   T   |
| T | F |   F   |
| F | T |   F   |
| F | F |   F   |
=================

e.g.
let p be the proposition "snow is white" and q be the proposition "roses are animals"
p ∧ q is false, as q is false (p is hence ignored)

<b>## disjunction</b>

p ∨ q is the disjunction of p and q. equivalent to "or" in a logical sense
<b>### not exclusive or.</b>
p ∨ q is true if p is true or q is true, else it is false.

=================
| p | q | p ∨ q |
=================
| T | T |   T   |
| T | F |   T   |
| F | T |   T   |
| F | F |   F   |
=================

e.g.
using p and q from the prior example,
p ∨ q is true, as p is true (q is hence not required to be true)

<b>## material implication</b>
this is a basic logical implication
p ⇒ q represents "if p, then q". this *can* be represented by ¬p ∨ q.
this is only false if p is true and q is false, otherwise it is true.

=================
| p | q | p ⇒ q |
=================
| T | T |   T   |
| T | F |   F   |
| F | T |   T   |
| F | F |   T   |
=================

p is the "antecedent", and q is the "consequent" in this form

<b>### modus ponens</b>
((p ⇒ q) ∧ p) ⇒ q
if p implies q, and p is true, then q is true.

<b>### modus tollens</b>
((p ⇒ q) ∧ ¬q) ⇒  ¬p
if p implies q, and q is false, then p is false.

<b>### implications</b>
if (p ⇒ q), then:
- p is a sufficient condition for q, but is not necessary
- q is a necessary condition for p

<b>## biconditional</b>
p ⇔ q is the "biconditional" of p and q?
represents "if and only if" or logical equivalence
("if and only if" can be represented by "iff")

can be represented by (p ⇒ q) ∧ (q ⇒ p)

=================================
| p | q | p ⇒ q | q ⇒ p | p ⇔ q |
=================================
| T | T |   T   |   T   |   T   |
| T | F |   F   |   T   |   F   |
| F | T |   T   |   F   |   F   |
| F | F |   T   |   T   |   T   |
=================================

<b>### remark</b>
in definitions, "if" can be interpreted as "if and only if"

e.g. n is even if there exists an integer m where n=2m

<b>### contrapositive!!</b>
(p ⇒ q) ⇔ (¬q ⇒ ¬p)
this follows from modus ponens and modus tollens

<b>### some trivial observations</b>
(¬(¬p)) ⇔ p (Double negation)

(p ∧ q) ⇔ (q ∧ p) (Commutative property for conjunction)
(p ∧ q) ∧ r ⇔ p ∧ (q ∧ r) (Associative property for conjunction)

(p ∨ q) ⇔ (q ∨ p) (Commutative property for disjunction)
(p ∨ q) ∨ r ⇔ p ∨ (q ∨ r) (Associative property for disjunction)

p ∧ (q ∨ r) ⇔ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r) (Distributive property)

<b>## de morgan's laws</b>

(i)  ¬(p ∨ q) ⇔ (¬p) ∧ (¬q)
(ii) ¬(p ∧ q) ⇔ (¬p) ∨ (¬q)

<b># predicate logic</b>
suppose x is a variable. p(x) is a "predicate" if it is a statement
containing the symbol x which becomes a proposition when we substitute
the symbol x with a value from a specific domain D.

e.g. "x + 1 = 2" is a predicate. if we substitute x = 1, we get the proposition "1 + 1 = 2".

<b>## quantifiers</b>
p(x) is true for all x => ∀ x, p(x) [ universal quantifier ]
there exists an x where p(x) is true, ∃ x : p(x) [ existential quantifier ]

( this part is not typable, due to subscripts. let a_b represent a subscript b )

∀_p(x) x, q(x) is the proposition (∀ x, p(x) ⇒  q(x))
∃_p(x) x : q(x) is the proposition (∃ x : p(x) ∧ q(x))

consider the proposition "all people are mortal".
this can be represented with:
p(x) = "x is a person"
q(x) = "x is mortal"
the proposition can be represented with ∀_p(x) x, q(x)

consider the proposition "there exists a person who is taller than 2 meters"
this can be represented with:
p(x) = "x is a person"
q(x) = "x is taller than 2 meters"
the proposition can be represented with ∃_p(x) x : q(x)

consider the predicate "(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1". this does not have a definite truth
value, since it is a general statement for any value of x. however, the statement
∀ x∈R, (x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
has a truth value (it is true), which means it is a proposition.

<b>### de morgan's laws for quantifiers</b>

let p(x) be a predicate that depends on a variable x. then:

(i)  ¬(∀ x, p(x)) ⇔ ∃x : ¬p(x)
    "if p(x) is false for all x, then there is an x where p(x) is false"
(ii) ¬(∃ x : p(x)) ⇔ ∀ x , ¬p(x)
    "if there is not an x where p(x) is true, then p(x) is false for all x"

let q(x) be another predicate that depends on the same variable x. then:

(i)  ¬(∀_p(x) x, q(x)) ⇔ ∃_p(x) x : ¬q(x)
(ii) ¬(∃_p(x) x : q(x)) ⇔ ∀_p(x) x , ¬q(x)

<b>### note</b>
∃ x : ∃ y : p(x,y) ⇔ ∃ y : ∃ x : p(x,y)
∀ x, ∀ y, p(x,y) ⇔ ∀ y, ∀ x, p(x,y)

BUT this is not true if you have different quantifiers!!!

e.g. ∃ y : ∀ x, y > x is false. "there is a largest real number"
but, ∀ x, ∃ y : y > x is true. "every number has a number that is larger than it"

<b>## definition of equality</b>

(i)  ∀ x, (x = x)
(ii) let p(k) be a predicate that depends on a variable k. then,
    ∀ x,y, (x = y) ⇔ ( p(x) ⇔ p(y) )

from this follows these results:
(i)  ∀ x,y, (x = y) ⇒ (y = x) [ symmetric property ]
(ii) ∀ x,y,z, ((x = y) ∧ (y = z)) ⇒ (x = z) [ transitive property ]

the proof of these is trivial

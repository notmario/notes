posts <--

This is a file in a subfolder. It should automatically
be linked to on the main page, as it has a "posts <--"
marking at the top of it. Notice how this file is nice
and all of the lines line up. This is not a feature in
postssg, you will have to do this yourself. But if you
want to do it you can. It looks good, however you will
have to spend a lot more time writing your documents..
